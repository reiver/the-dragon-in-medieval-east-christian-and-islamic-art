“dragon iconography [was transmitted] from Central Asia to Anatolia”

“Today “Central Asia” has acquired a narrower meaning associating it with its use in the former Soviet Union and can be said to include the territories of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan as well as Mongolia, the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Province in northwest China. However throughout the present study the term is used in its broader sense following the cultural definition of Central Asia given by UNESCO in two meetings of experts, held in 1978 and 1979, which is anchored in the multi-volume 《History of Civilization of Central Asia》. The Final Report of 12 February 1979, Paris, reads that the spatial dimensions include “territories lying at present within the boundaries of Afghanistan, the western part of China, northern India, northeastern Iran, Mongolia, Pakistan and the [former] Central Asian Republics of the USSR.” See Miroshnikov, 1992, repr.1999, pp. 259–80 (the discussion also includes a brief outline of the historical usage of the term).The problems of defining the conceptual geographies of Central Asia are revisited by Akiner, 1998, pp. 3–62”
